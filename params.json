It provides all the basic OCSS one needs to set the foundation to a simple responsive site. With that said, feel free to update the variables for the polish and custom styles one needs for a given project.\r\n\r\n## Base HTML\r\nFramework MX uses HTML5 as its backbone.  We use a number of HTML5 elements that make our lives easier that require the HTML5 doctype.  Include it at the beginning of your projects.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  ...\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Normalize and Reset\r\nYou'll notice at the top of the file we use a number or reset properties. Although we're not using the whole file, we are using the best parts in our option.",
