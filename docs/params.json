  "body": "Framework MX\r\n============\r\nBase simple responsive framework to rapidly build websites.  This framework is a simple OCSS framework.  It provides all the basic OCSS one needs to set the foundation to a simple responsive site. With that said, feel free to update the variables for the polish and custom styles one needs for a given project.\r\n\r\n## Base HTML\r\nFramework MX uses HTML5 as its backbone.  We use a number of HTML5 elements that make our lives easier that require the HTML5 doctype.  Include it at the beginning of your projects.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html lang=\"en\">\r\n  ...\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Normalize and Reset\r\nYou'll notice at the top of the file we use a number or reset properties from Normalize.css, a project by Nicolas Gallagher and Jonathan Neal . Although we're not using the whole file, we are using the best parts for our needs in our option.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Grid System\r\nThe grid system for Framework MX using a 10 column percentage based system making a 1020 px default width container.\r\n\r\n### Basic grid\r\nFor a simple two column layout create a ```.grid``` as the top most parent element to ensure your flex grid and add the a number of ```span-*-*``` columns inside depending on the number of columns desired.  The syntax span 1 of 2 means that this column spans or is column 1 of 2 total columns.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"grid\">\r\n    <div class=\"span-1-2\"></div>\r\n    <div class=\"span-1-2\"></div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Responsive\r\nFramework MX supports a number of media queries to support varying device widths and resolutions.\r\n\r\n```css\r\n// Mobile Landscape\r\n@media only screen and (min-width: 400px) { ... }\r\n\r\n// Tablet Portrait\r\n@media only screen and (min-width: 568px) { ... }\r\n\r\n// Tablet Landscape\r\n@media only screen and (min-width: 769px) { ... }\r\n\r\n// Desktop\r\n@media only screen and (min-width: 1020px) { ... }\r\n\r\n// Desktop Wide & HD TV\r\n@media only screen and (min-width: 1200px) { ... }\r\n```\r\n",
