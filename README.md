Framework MX
============
Base simple responsive framework to rapidly build websites.  This framework is a simple OCSS framework.  It provides all the basic OCSS one needs to set the foundation to a simple responisve site. With that said, feel free to update the variables for the polish and custom styles one needs for a given project.

## Base HTML
Framework MX uses HTML5 as its backbone.  We use a number of HTML5 elements that make our lives easier that require the HTML5 doctype.  Include it at the beginning of your projects.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Normalize and Reset
You'll notice at the top of the file we use a number or reset properites. Although we're not using the whole file, we are using the best parts in our option.
