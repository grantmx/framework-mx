Framework MX
============
Base simple responsive framework to rapidly build websites

## Base HTML
Framework MX uses HTML5 as its backbone.  We use a number of HTML5 elements that make our lives easier that require the HTML5 doctype.  Include it at the beginning of your projects.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```

## Normalize
You'll notice at the top of the file we use a number or reset properites.  We're using the best of normalize.css.  Although we're not using the whole file, we are using the best parts in our option.


## Layout & Grid
Our grid system is a 12-grid percentage based layout that spans the full 100% of its container. We have an ```.inner``` class that limits the width to 1024px.
