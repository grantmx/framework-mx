Framework-mx
============
Base simple responsive framework to rapidly build websites

## Base HTML
Framework-mx uses HTML5 as its backbone.  We use a number of HTML5 elements that make our lives easier that require the HTML5 doctype.  Include it at the beginning of your projects.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  ...
</html>
```
